*****Welcome to Gratitude Space.********
Often, good moments happen that can go unnoticed. Gratitude practice helps us build the skill of noticing and appreciating these moments, which in turn re-wires our brain to being less sensitive to stress and more prone to experiencing flourishing and wellbeing. Use this app as often as you can to record moments you can feel grateful for that might otherwise go unnoticed.

We will ask you for a mood rating before and after your gratitude entries, to help you track how gratitude practice affects your mood.
